    Happy Eyeballs Version 3: Better Connectivity Using Concurrency
                draft-ietf-happy-happyeyeballs-v3-latest

Abstract

   Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
   hostnames.  These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of
   which may have different performance and connectivity
   characteristics.  Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4
   or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients
   that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
   establishing a connection more quickly.  This document specifies
   requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and
   provides an example algorithm, referred to as "Happy Eyeballs".  This
   document updates the algorithm description in RFC 8305.

1.  Introduction

   Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
   hostnames.  These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of
   which may have different performance and connectivity
   characteristics.  Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4
   or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients
   that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
   establishing a connection more quickly.  This document specifies
   requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and
   provides an example algorithm.

   This document defines the algorithm for "Happy Eyeballs", a technique
   for reducing user-visible delays on dual-stack hosts.  This
   definition updates the description in [HEV2], which itself obsoleted
   [RFC6555].

   The Happy Eyeballs algorithm of racing connections to resolved
   addresses has several stages to avoid delays to the user whenever
   possible, while respecting client priorities, such as preferring the
   use of IPv6 or the availability of protocols like HTTP/3 [HTTP3] or
   TLS Encrypted Client Hello [ECH].  This document discusses how to
   initiate DNS queries when starting a connection, how to sort the list
   of destination addresses received from DNS answers, and how to race
   the connection attempts.

   The major difference between the algorithm defined in this document
   and [HEV2] is the addition of support for SVCB / HTTPS resource
   records [SVCB].  SVCB records provide alternative endpoints and
   information about application protocol support, Encrypted Client
   Hello [ECH] keys, address hints, and other relevant details about the
   services being accessed.  Discovering protocol support during
   resolution, such as for HTTP/3 over QUIC [HTTP3], allows upgrading
   between protocols on the current connection attempts, instead of
   waiting for subsequent attempts to use information from other
   discovery mechanisms such as HTTP Alternative Services [AltSvc].
   These records can be queried along with A and AAAA records, and the
   updated algorithm defines how to handle SVCB responses to improve
   connection establishment.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview

   This document defines a method of connection establishment, named the
   "Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup".  This approach has several
   distinct phases:

   1.  Initiation of asynchronous DNS queries (Section 4)

   2.  Sorting of resolved destination addresses (Section 5)

   3.  Initiation of asynchronous connection attempts (Section 6)

   4.  Establishment of one connection, which cancels all other attempts
       (Section 6)

   Note that this document assumes that the preference policy for the
   host destination address favors IPv6 over IPv4.  IPv6 has many
   desirable properties designed to be improvements over IPv4 [IPV6].

   This document also assumes that the preference policy favors QUIC
   over TCP.  QUIC only requires one packet to establish a secure
   connection, making it quicker compared to TCP [QUIC].

   If the host is configured to have different preferences, the
   recommendations in this document can be easily adapted.

4.  Hostname Resolution Query Handling

   When a client has both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity and is trying to
   establish a connection with a named host, it needs to send out both
   AAAA and A DNS queries.  Both queries SHOULD be made as soon after
   one another as possible, with the AAAA query made first and
   immediately followed by the A query.

   Additionally, if the client also wants to receive SVCB / HTTPS
   resource records [SVCB], it SHOULD issue the SVCB query immediately
   before the AAAA and A queries (prioritizing the SVCB query since it
   can also include address hints).  If the client has only one of IPv4
   or IPv6 connectivity, it still issues the SVCB query prior to
   whichever AAAA or A query is appropriate.  Note that upon receiving a
   SVCB answer, the client might need to issue futher AAAA and/or A
   queries to resolve the service name included in the record.

   Implementations SHOULD NOT wait for all answers to return before
   attempting connection establishment.  If one query fails to return or
   takes significantly longer to return, waiting for the other answers
   can significantly delay the connection establishment of the first
   one.  Therefore, the client SHOULD treat DNS resolution as
   asynchronous.  Note that if the platform does not offer an
   asynchronous DNS API, this behavior can be simulated by making
   separate synchronous queries, each on a different thread.

   The algorithm for acting upon received answers depends on whether the
   client sent out queries for SVCB records.

   If the client did not request SVCB records:

   *  If a valid AAAA record is received first, the first IPv6
      connection attempt is immediately started.

   *  If a valid A record is received first (which might be due to
      reordering), the client SHOULD wait a short time to receive AAAA
      records to ensure that preference is given to IPv6, since it is
      common to receive AAAA records following A records by a few
      milliseconds.  This delay is referred to as the "Resolution
      Delay".  If a negative AAAA response (no error, no data) is
      received within the Resolution Delay period or a AAAA record has
      not been received by the end of the Resolution Delay period, the
      client SHOULD proceed to sorting addresses (see Section 5) and
      staggered connection attempts (see Section 6) using any IPv4
      addresses received so far.

   If the client did request SVCB records:

   *  If the client receives any valid AAAA, A, or SVCB ServiceMode
      records, it starts the Resolution Delay timer, which is run until
      both the AAAA and SVCB ServiceMode responses are received, or a
      SVCB response is received that also includes at least one address
      in the ipv6hint parameter.  Once a SVCB response and at least one
      IPv6 address have been received, or the timer expires, the client
      proceeds with the process of sorting addresses and staggered
      connection attempts.

   For both variations of the algorithm, the RECOMMENDED value for the
   Resolution Delay is 50 milliseconds.

   If new records arrive while connection attempts are in progress, but
   before any connection has been established, then any newly received
   addresses are incorporated into the list of available candidate
   addresses (see Section 7) and the process of connection attempts will
   continue with the new addresses added, until one connection is
   established.

4.1.  Handling Multiple DNS Server Addresses

   If multiple DNS server addresses are configured for the current
   network, the client may have the option of sending its DNS queries
   over IPv4 or IPv6.  In keeping with the Happy Eyeballs approach,
   queries SHOULD be sent over IPv6 first (note that this is not
   referring to the sending of AAAA or A queries, but rather the address
   of the DNS server itself and IP version used to transport DNS
   messages).  If DNS queries sent to the IPv6 address do not receive
   responses, that address may be marked as penalized and queries can be
   sent to other DNS server addresses.

   As native IPv6 deployments become more prevalent and IPv4 addresses
   are exhausted, it is expected that IPv6 connectivity will have
   preferential treatment within networks.  If a DNS server is
   configured to be accessible over IPv6, IPv6 should be assumed to be
   the preferred address family.

   Client systems SHOULD NOT have an explicit limit to the number of DNS
   servers that can be configured, either manually or by the network.
   If such a limit is required by hardware limitations, the client
   SHOULD use at least one address from each address family from the
   available list.

5.  Sorting Addresses

   Before attempting to connect to any of the resolved destination
   addresses, the client should define the order in which to start the
   attempts.  Once the order has been defined, the client can use a
   simple algorithm for racing each option after a short delay (see
   Section 6).  It is important that the ordered list involve all
   addresses from both families and all protocols that have been
   received by this point, as this allows the client to get the racing
   effect of Happy Eyeballs for the entire list, not just the first IPv4
   and first IPv6 addresses.

   Note that the following sorting steps are an incremental sort,
   meaning that the client SHOULD sort within each sorted group for each
   incremental step.

   If any of the answers were from SVCB records, they SHOULD be sorted
   ahead of any answers that were not associated with a SVCB record.

   If the client supports TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) discovery
   through SVCB records [SVCB-ECH], depending on the client's preference
   to handle ECH, the client SHOULD sort addresses with ECH keys taking
   priority to maintain privacy when attempting connection
   establishment.

   The client then sorts the addresses received up to this point, within
   each group, by service priority if the set of addresses contain any
   answers from SVCB records.  See Section 5.1 for details.

   The client SHOULD also sort the addresses in protocol order, such
   that QUIC is prioritized over TCP, as it connects faster and
   generally results in a better experience once connected.  For
   example, QUIC provides improved delivery and congestion control,
   supports connection migration, and provides other benefits [QUIC].

   Then, within each group at equal priority, the client MUST sort the
   addresses using Destination Address Selection ([RFC6724], Section 6).

   If the client is stateful and has a history of expected round-trip
   times (RTTs) for the routes to access each address, it SHOULD add a
   Destination Address Selection rule between rules 8 and 9 that prefers
   addresses with lower RTTs.  If the client keeps track of which
   addresses it used in the past, it SHOULD add another Destination
   Address Selection rule between the RTT rule and rule 9, which prefers
   used addresses over unused ones.  This helps servers that use the
   client's IP address during authentication, as is the case for TCP
   Fast Open [RFC7413] and some Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)
   cookies.  This historical data MUST NOT be used across different
   network interfaces and SHOULD be flushed whenever a device changes
   the network to which it is attached.

   Next, the client SHOULD modify the ordered list to interleave
   protocols and address families.  Whichever combination of protocol
   and address family is first in the list should be followed by an
   endpoint of the other protocol type and same address family, then an
   endpoint from the same protocol and other address family, and then an
   endpoint from the other protocol and other address family.  For
   example, if the first address in the sorted list is a QUIC IPv6
   address, then the first TCP IPv6 address should be moved up in the
   list to be second in the list, then the first QUIC IPv4 address
   should be moved up to be third in the list, and then the first TCP
   IPv4 address should be moved up to be fourth in the list.  An
   implementation MAY choose to favor one protocol or address family
   more by allowing multiple addresses of that protocol or family to be
   attempted before trying the other combinations.  The number of
   contiguous addresses of the first combination of properties will be
   referred to as the "Preferred Protocol Combination Count" and can be
   a configurable value.  This avoids waiting through a long list of
   addresses from a given address family using a given protocol if
   connectivity over a protocol or an address family is impaired.

   Note that the address selection described in this section only
   applies to destination addresses; Source Address Selection
   ([RFC6724-UPDATE], Section 3.2) is performed once per destination
   address and is out of scope of this document.

5.1.  Sorting Based on Priority

   SVCB [SVCB] records indicate a priority for each ServiceMode
   response.  This priority applies to any IPv4 or IPv6 address hints in
   the record itself, as well as any addresses received on A or AAAA
   queries for the name in the ServiceMode record.  The priority in a
   SVCB ServiceMode record is always greater than 0.

   SVCB answers with the lowest numerical value (such as 1) are sorted
   first, and answers with higher numerical values are sorted later.

   Note that a SVCB record with the TargetName "." applies to the owner
   name in the record, and the priority of that SVCB record applies to
   any A or AAAA records for the same owner name.  These answers are
   sorted according to that SVCB record's priority.

6.  Connection Attempts

   Once the list of addresses received up to this point has been
   constructed, the client will attempt to make connections.  In order
   to avoid unreasonable network load, connection attempts SHOULD NOT be
   made simultaneously.  Instead, one connection attempt to a single
   address is started first, followed by the others in the list, one at
   a time.  Starting a new connection attempt does not affect previous
   attempts, as multiple connection attempts may occur in parallel.
   Once one of the connection attempts succeeds (Section 6.1), all other
   connections attempts that have not yet succeeded SHOULD be canceled.
   Any address that was not yet attempted as a connection SHOULD be
   ignored.  At that time, the asynchronous DNS query MAY be canceled as
   new addresses will not be used for this connection.  However, the DNS
   client resolver SHOULD still process DNS replies from the network for
   a short period of time (recommended to be 1 second), as they will
   populate the DNS cache and can be used for subsequent connections.

   A simple implementation can have a fixed delay for how long to wait
   before starting the next connection attempt.  This delay is referred
   to as the "Connection Attempt Delay".  One recommended value for a
   default delay is 250 milliseconds.  A more nuanced implementation's
   delay should correspond to the time when the previous attempt is
   retrying its handshake (such as sending a second TCP SYN or a second
   QUIC Initial), based on the retransmission timer ([RFC6298],
   [RFC9002]).  If the client has historical RTT data gathered from
   other connections to the same host or prefix, it can use this
   information to influence its delay.  Note that this algorithm should
   only try to approximate the time of the first handshake packet
   retransmission, and not any further retransmissions that may be
   influenced by exponential timer back off.

   The Connection Attempt Delay MUST have a lower bound, especially if
   it is computed using historical data.  More specifically, a
   subsequent connection MUST NOT be started within 10 milliseconds of
   the previous attempt.  The recommended minimum value is 100
   milliseconds, which is referred to as the "Minimum Connection Attempt
   Delay".  This minimum value is required to avoid congestion collapse
   in the presence of high packet-loss rates.  The Connection Attempt
   Delay SHOULD have an upper bound, referred to as the "Maximum
   Connection Attempt Delay".  The current recommended value is 2
   seconds.

6.1.  Determining successful connection establishment

   The determination of when a connection attempt has successfully
   completed (and other attempts can be cancelled) depends on the
   protocols being used to establish a connection.  This can involve one
   or more protocol handshakes.

   Client connections that use TCP only (without TLS or another protocol
   on top, such as for unencrypted HTTP connections) will determine
   successful establishment based on completing the TCP handshake only.
   When TLS is used on top of of TCP (such as for encrypted HTTP
   connections), clients MAY choose to wait for the TLS handshake to
   successfully complete before cancelling other connection attempts.
   This is particularly useful for networks in which a TCP-terminating
   proxy might be causing TCP handshakes to succeed quickly, even though
   end-to-end connectivity with the TLS-terminating server will fail.
   QUIC connections inherently include a secure handshake in their main
   handshakes, and thus only need to wait for a single handshake to
   complete.

   While transport layer handshakes generally do not have restrictions
   on attempts to establish a connection, some cryptographic handshakes
   may be dependent on SVCB ServiceMode records and could impose
   limitations on establishing a connection.  For instance, ECH-capable
   clients may become SVCB-reliant clients (Section 3 of [SVCB]) when
   SVCB records contain the "ech" SvcParamKey [SVCB-ECH].  If the client
   is either an SVCB-reliant client or a SVCB-optional client that might
   switch to SVCB-reliant connection establishment during the process,
   the client MUST wait for SVCB records before proceeding with the
   cryptographic handshake.

6.2.  Handling Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)

   The alpn and no-default-alpn SvcParamKeys in SVCB records indicate
   the "SVCB ALPN set," which specifies the underlying transport
   protocols supported by the associated service endpoint.  When the
   client requests SVCB records, it SHOULD perform the procedure
   specified in Section 7.1.2 of [SVCB] to determine the underlying
   transport protocols that both the client and the service endpoint
   support.  The client SHOULD NOT attempt to make a connection to a
   service endpoint whose SVCB ALPN set does not contain any protocols
   that the client supports.  For example, suppose the client is an HTTP
   client that only supports TCP-based versions such as HTTP/1.1 and
   HTTP/2, and it receives the following HTTPS record:

    example.com. 60 IN HTTPS 1 svc1.example.com. (
        alpn="h3" no-default-alpn ipv6hint=2001:db8::2 )

   In this case, attempting a connection to 2001:db8::2 or any other
   address resolved for svc1.example.com would be incorrect because the
   record indicates that svc1.example.com only supports HTTP/3, based on
   the ALPN value of "h3".

   If the client is an HTTP client that supports both Alt-Svc [AltSvc]
   and SVCB (HTTPS) records, the client SHOULD ensure that connection
   attempts are consistent with both the Alt-Svc parameters and the SVCB
   ALPN set, as specified in Section 9.3 of [SVCB].

7.  DNS Answer Changes During Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup

   If, during the course of connection establishment, the DNS answers
   change by either adding resolved addresses (for example due to DNS
   push notifications [RFC8765]) or removing previously resolved
   addresses (for example, due to expiry of the TTL on that DNS record),
   the client should react based on its current progress.  Additionally,
   once A and AAAA records are received, addresses received via SVCB
   hints that are not included in the A and AAAA records for the
   corresponding address family SHOULD be removed from the list, as
   specified in Section 7.3 of [SVCB].

   If an address is removed from the list that already had a connection
   attempt started, the connection attempt SHOULD NOT be canceled, but
   rather be allowed to continue.  If the removed address had not yet
   had a connection attempt started, it SHOULD be removed from the list
   of addresses to try.

   If an address is added to the list, it should be sorted into the list
   of addresses not yet attempted according to the rules above (see
   Section 5).

8.  Supporting IPv6-Only Networks with NAT64 and DNS64

   While many IPv6 transition protocols have been standardized and
   deployed, most are transparent to client devices.  The combined use
   of NAT64 [RFC6146] and DNS64 [RFC6147] is a popular solution that is
   being deployed and requires changes in client devices.  One possible
   way to handle these networks is for the client device networking
   stack to implement 464XLAT [RFC6877]. 464XLAT has the advantage of
   not requiring changes to user space software; however, it requires
   per-packet translation if the application is using IPv4 literals and
   does not encourage client application software to support native
   IPv6.  On platforms that do not support 464XLAT, the Happy Eyeballs
   engine SHOULD follow the recommendations in this section to properly
   support IPv6-only networks with NAT64 and DNS64.

   The features described in this section SHOULD only be enabled when
   the host detects one of these networks.  A simple heuristic to
   achieve that is to check if the network offers routable IPv6
   addressing, does not offer routable IPv4 addressing, and offers a DNS
   resolver address.

8.1.  IPv4 Address Literals

   If client applications or users wish to connect to IPv4 address
   literals, the Happy Eyeballs engine will need to perform NAT64
   address synthesis for them.  The solution is similar to "Bump-in-the-
   Host" [RFC6535] but is implemented inside the Happy Eyeballs library.

   Note that some IPv4 prefixes are scoped to a given host or network,
   such as 0.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16, and
   255.255.255.255/32, and therefore do not require NAT64 address
   synthesis.

   When an IPv4 address is passed into the library instead of a
   hostname, the device SHOULD use PREF64s received from Router
   Advertisements [RFC8781].  If the network does not provide PREF64s,
   the device SHOULD query the network for the NAT64 prefix using
   "Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis"
   [RFC7050].  It then synthesizes an appropriate IPv6 address (or
   several) using the encoding described in "IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/
   IPv6 Translators" [RFC6052].  The synthesized addresses are then
   inserted into the list of addresses as if they were results from DNS
   queries; connection attempts follow the algorithm described above
   (see Section 6).

   Such translation also applies to any IPv4 addresses received in A
   records and IPv4 address hints received in SVCB records.

8.2.  Hostnames with Broken AAAA Records

   At the time of writing, there exist a small but non-negligible number
   of hostnames that resolve to valid A records and broken AAAA records,
   which we define as AAAA records that contain seemingly valid IPv6
   addresses but those addresses never reply when contacted on the usual
   ports.  These can be, for example, caused by:

   *  Mistyping of the IPv6 address in the DNS zone configuration

   *  Routing black holes

   *  Service outages

   While an algorithm complying with the other sections of this document
   would correctly handle such hostnames on a dual-stack network, they
   will not necessarily function correctly on IPv6-only networks with
   NAT64 and DNS64.  Since DNS64 recursive resolvers rely on the
   authoritative name servers sending negative (no error, no data)
   responses for AAAA records in order to synthesize, they will not
   synthesize records for these particular hostnames and will instead
   pass through the broken AAAA record.

   In order to support these scenarios, the client device needs to query
   the DNS for the A record and then perform local synthesis.  Since
   these types of hostnames are rare and, in order to minimize load on
   DNS servers, this A query should only be performed when the client
   has given up on the AAAA records it initially received.  This can be
   achieved by using a longer timeout, referred to as the "Last Resort
   Local Synthesis Delay"; the delay is recommended to be 2 seconds.
   The timer is started when the last connection attempt is fired.  If
   no connection attempt has succeeded when this timer fires, the device
   queries the DNS for the IPv4 address and, on reception of a valid A
   record, treats it as if it were provided by the application (see
   Section 8.1).

8.3.  Virtual Private Networks

   Some Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) may be configured to handle DNS
   queries from the device.  The configuration could encompass all
   queries or a subset such as "*.internal.example.com".  These VPNs can
   also be configured to only route part of the IPv4 address space, such
   as 192.0.2.0/24.  However, if an internal hostname resolves to an
   external IPv4 address, these can cause issues if the underlying
   network is IPv6-only.  As an example, let's assume that
   "www.internal.example.com" has exactly one A record, 198.51.100.42,
   and no AAAA records.  The client will send the DNS query to the
   company's recursive resolver and that resolver will reply with these
   records.  The device now only has an IPv4 address to connect to and
   no route to that address.  Since the company's resolver does not know
   the NAT64 prefix of the underlying network, it cannot synthesize the
   address.  Similarly, the underlying network's DNS64 recursive
   resolver does not know the company's internal addresses, so it cannot
   resolve the hostname.  Because of this, the client device needs to
   resolve the A record using the company's resolver and then locally
   synthesize an IPv6 address, as if the resolved IPv4 address were
   provided by the application (Section 8.1).

9.  Summary of Configurable Values

   The values that may be configured as defaults on a client for use in
   Happy Eyeballs are as follows:

   *  Resolution Delay (Section 4): The time to wait for a AAAA record
      after receiving an A record.  Recommended to be 50 milliseconds.

   *  Preferred Protocol Combination Count (Section 5): The number of
      addresses belonging to the preferred address family (such as IPv6)
      using the preferred protocol (such as QUIC) that should be
      attempted before attempting the next combination of address family
      and protocol.  Recommended to be 1; 2 may be used to more
      aggressively favor a particular combination of address family and
      protocol.

   *  Connection Attempt Delay (Section 6): The time to wait between
      connection attempts in the absence of RTT data.  Recommended to be
      250 milliseconds.

   *  Minimum Connection Attempt Delay (Section 6): The minimum time to
      wait between connection attempts.  Recommended to be 100
      milliseconds.  MUST NOT be less than 10 milliseconds.

   *  Maximum Connection Attempt Delay (Section 6): The maximum time to
      wait between connection attempts.  Recommended to be 2 seconds.

   *  Last Resort Local Synthesis Delay (Section 8.2): The time to wait
      after starting the last IPv6 attempt and before sending the A
      query.  Recommended to be 2 seconds.

   The delay values described in this section were determined
   empirically by measuring the timing of connections on a very wide set
   of production devices.  They were picked to reduce wait times noticed
   by users while minimizing load on the network.  As time passes, it is
   expected that the properties of networks will evolve.  For that
   reason, it is expected that these values will change over time.
   Implementors should feel welcome to use different values without
   changing this specification.  Since IPv6 issues are expected to be
   less common, the delays SHOULD be increased with time as client
   software is updated.

10.  Limitations

   Happy Eyeballs will handle initial connection failures at the
   transport layer (such as TCP or QUIC); however, other failures or
   performance issues may still affect the chosen connection.

10.1.  Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery

   For TCP connections, since Happy Eyeballs is only active during the
   initial handshake and TCP does not pass the initial handshake, issues
   related to MTU can be masked and go unnoticed during Happy Eyeballs.
   For QUIC connections, a minimum MTU of at least 1200 bytes [RFC9000],
   Section 8.1-5 is guaranteed, but there is a chance that larger values
   may not be available.  Solving this issue is out of scope of this
   document.  One solution is to use "Packetization Layer Path MTU
   Discovery" [RFC4821].

10.2.  Application Layer

   If the DNS returns multiple addresses for different application
   servers, the application itself may not be operational and functional
   on all of them.  Common examples include Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) and HTTP.

10.3.  Hiding Operational Issues

   It has been observed in practice that Happy Eyeballs can hide issues
   in networks.  For example, if a misconfiguration causes IPv6 to
   consistently fail on a given network while IPv4 is still functional,
   Happy Eyeballs may impair the operator's ability to notice the issue.
   It is recommended that network operators deploy external means of
   monitoring to ensure functionality of all address families.

11.  Security Considerations

   Note that applications should not rely upon a stable hostname-to-
   address mapping to ensure any security properties, since DNS results
   may change between queries.  Happy Eyeballs may make it more likely
   that subsequent connections to a single hostname use different IP
   addresses.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.
