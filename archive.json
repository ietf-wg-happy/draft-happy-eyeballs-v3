Otherwise, an active attacker could mount a downgrade attack by denying the user access to the SvcParams.\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\nFor further context, the specific downgrade attack we were worried about when drafting that paragraph is that a network-level attacker could using timing/size analysis to figure out which QUIC packets contained the HTTPS response and block just those while allowing A/AAAA through.  The client would then get A and AAAA, but HTTPS would either be blackholed or return one of the errors listed above, depending on how and where the attacker blocks the HTTPS packets.\r\n\r\nSo if the client then proceeds to attempt connection past the point where ECH could have been used, it means you've given attackers the ability to block ECH without piercing the encrypted DoH connection.  So we're not just talking a privacy loss of sometimes missing out on ECH when the response doesn't arrive in time.  We're talking a security compromise scenario where the attacker can completely and deliberately prevent ECH from ever being used.\r\n\r\n@davidben Since I believe he was also in many of those conversations and might have thoughts.",

Why is TCP IPv6 preferred over QUIC IPv4? Does this also mean that the dial delay to misconfigured IPv6 servers with a fixed delay is 500ms now? \r\n\r\n2. What happens when there's only a QUIC IPv4 and TCP IPv6 address. I assume the preference is QUIC IPv4 over TCP IPv6, as the draft says. I understand, this ia a highly unusual situation.\r\n\r\n> The client SHOULD also sort the addresses in protocol order, such that QUIC is prioritized over TCP, as it connects faster and generally results in a better experience once connected.\r\n\r\n",

Absolutely the correct thing to do.\r\n\r\nBut I don't see any real discussion of what to do when A/AAAA is subsequently received with different addresses before connection succeeds, especially for the case where the hint addresses are not present.  Because A/AAAA addresses are generally better than hint addresses (because it's easier for the server to provide optimized or load-balanced addresses), I believe the best behavior would be to remove hint-only addresses from the connection list, similar to other removals discussed in Section 7 (\"DNS Answer Changes During Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup\").  Removing the addresses in this case would also be most consistent with the RFC9460#7.3 \"SHOULD\" to ignore hints if A/AAAA are locally available.",

This can involve one or more protocol handshakes.\r\n\r\nClient connections that use TCP only (without TLS or another protocol on top, such\r\nas for unencrypted HTTP connections) will determine successful establishment based\r\non completing the TCP handshake only. When TLS is used on top of of TCP (such\r\nas for encrypted HTTP connections), clients MAY choose to wait for the TLS handshake to\r\nsuccessfully complete before cancelling other connection attempts. This is particularly\r\nuseful for networks in which a TCP-terminating proxy might be causing TCP handshakes\r\nto succeed quickly, even though end-to-end connectivity with the TLS-terminating\r\nserver will fail. QUIC connections inherently include a secure handshake in their main\r\nhandshakes, and thus only need to wait for a single handshake to complete.\r\n```",
