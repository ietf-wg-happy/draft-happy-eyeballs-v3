Otherwise, an active attacker could mount a downgrade attack by denying the user access to the SvcParams.\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\nFor further context, the specific downgrade attack we were worried about when drafting that paragraph is that a network-level attacker could using timing/size analysis to figure out which QUIC packets contained the HTTPS response and block just those while allowing A/AAAA through.  The client would then get A and AAAA, but HTTPS would either be blackholed or return one of the errors listed above, depending on how and where the attacker blocks the HTTPS packets.\r\n\r\nSo if the client then proceeds to attempt connection past the point where ECH could have been used, it means you've given attackers the ability to block ECH without piercing the encrypted DoH connection.  So we're not just talking a privacy loss of sometimes missing out on ECH when the response doesn't arrive in time.  We're talking a security compromise scenario where the attacker can completely and deliberately prevent ECH from ever being used.\r\n\r\n@davidben Since I believe he was also in many of those conversations and might have thoughts.",

Why is TCP IPv6 preferred over QUIC IPv4? Does this also mean that the dial delay to misconfigured IPv6 servers with a fixed delay is 500ms now? \r\n\r\n2. What happens when there's only a QUIC IPv4 and TCP IPv6 address. I assume the preference is QUIC IPv4 over TCP IPv6, as the draft says. I understand, this ia a highly unusual situation.\r\n\r\n> The client SHOULD also sort the addresses in protocol order, such that QUIC is prioritized over TCP, as it connects faster and generally results in a better experience once connected.\r\n\r\n",

Absolutely the correct thing to do.\r\n\r\nBut I don't see any real discussion of what to do when A/AAAA is subsequently received with different addresses before connection succeeds, especially for the case where the hint addresses are not present.  Because A/AAAA addresses are generally better than hint addresses (because it's easier for the server to provide optimized or load-balanced addresses), I believe the best behavior would be to remove hint-only addresses from the connection list, similar to other removals discussed in Section 7 (\"DNS Answer Changes During Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup\").  Removing the addresses in this case would also be most consistent with the RFC9460#7.3 \"SHOULD\" to ignore hints if A/AAAA are locally available.",

That variant was specified with the following in mind:\r\n\r\n> Such a procedure is needed to avoid experiencing long connection delays. For example, if an IPv4 path to a DOTS server is functional, but the DOTS server's IPv6 path is nonfunctional, a dual-stack DOTS client may experience a significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only DOTS client in the same network conditions. The other problem is that if a middlebox between the DOTS client and DOTS server is configured to block UDP traffic, the DOTS client will fail to establish a DTLS association with the DOTS server; consequently, it will have to fall back to TLS over TCP, thereby incurring significant connection delays.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the RFC for more details, including deviations vs [RFC8305](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305).\r\n\r\nI suggest to a add a charter item to inventory such uses.\r\n",

If the most preferred endpoint failed recently, can the client skip it the next time?\r\n\r\nAnd what about highly optimized clients that are racing multiple connections?  Can they race connections across multiple SvcPriorities, or should they wait until all the priority 1 endpoints fail?\r\n\r\nEven in the simple case, the definition of \"failure\" is somewhat nebulous.  TCP (and QUIC) connection initiation generally relies on exponential backoff that may not give up until multiple minutes have passed.  Surely we don't want clients to wait 100+ seconds before trying the priority 2 endpoint...\r\n\r\nThese questions are obviously relevant to mobile- and browser-like clients.  They're also increasingly relevant to DNS servers, as the DELEG group is considering SVCB-based definitions of DNS delegation.  DNS resolvers already use complex heuristics to estimate the latency and reliability of each nameserver, in order to select the best one (while still monitoring the others).\r\n\r\n@enygren @mikebishop",

When TLS is used on top of of TCP (such\r\nas for encrypted HTTP connections), clients MAY choose to wait for the TLS handshake to\r\nsuccessfully complete before cancelling other connection attempts. This is particularly\r\nuseful for networks in which a TCP-terminating proxy might be causing TCP handshakes\r\nto succeed quickly, even though end-to-end connectivity with the TLS-terminating\r\nserver will fail.
